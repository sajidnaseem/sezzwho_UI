        <p lang="en-CA">You  may use our Service only as permitted by law, to submit, share and  comment upon content or for such other commercial purpose of the  Service as might be modified from time to time. We may suspend or  stop providing our Service to you if you do not comply with our terms  or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</p>
      <p lang="en-CA">Using  our Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property  rights in our Service or the content you access. You may not use  content from our Service unless you obtain permission from its owner  or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the  right to use any branding or logos used in our Service. Don&rsquo;t  remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along  with our Service.</p>
        <p lang="en-CA">Our  Service displays some content that is not ours – we may post  content of other users or of third parties.

For example, we don&rsquo;t make  any commitments about the content within the Service, the specific  functions of the Service, or their reliability, availability or  ability to meet your needs. We provide the Service &ldquo;as is&rdquo;.</p>
        <p lang="en-CA">Some  jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied  warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,  noninfringement, data accuracy and data securit . To the extent  permitted by law we exclude any and all warranties including any such  implied or statutory warranties to the greatest extent that they can  be disclaimed.</p>
        <h2 lang="en-CA"><strong>Liability  for our Service</strong></h2>
        <p lang="en-CA">When  permitted by law, we are not responsible for lost profits, revenues,  or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential,  exemplary or punitive damages. To the extent permitted by law, the  total liability of Sezzwho for any claims under these terms,  including for implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid  us to use the Service, or if we should choose to do so to supplying  you the Service again.</p>
        <p lang="en-CA">In  all cases, Sezzwho will not be liable for any loss or damage that is  not reasonably foreseeable- for example if <span lang="en-US">you</span> lose revenue, salary, profits or reputation as a result of <span lang="en-US">your</span> use of the Service, and/or for the acts or omissions of any third  party such as other users of the Service, or any other indirect or  consequential loss or damage <span lang="en-US">you</span> may incur in relation to the Service and its <span lang="en-US">Content</span>.</p>
        <p lang="en-CA"><span lang="en-US">We</span> are not liable to <span lang="en-US">you</span> for any breach of these terms caused by any event or circumstance  beyond <span lang="en-US">our</span> reasonable control including, without limitation, strikes, lock-outs  and other industrial disputes, breakdown of systems or network  access, flood, fire, explosion or accident.</p>
        <h2 lang="en-CA"><strong>Business  uses of our Service</strong></h2>
        <p lang="en-CA">If  you are using our Service on behalf of a business, that business  accepts these terms.

        <h2 lang="en-CA"><strong>About  these Terms</strong></h2>
        <p lang="en-CA">We  may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to the  Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our  Service. You should look at the terms regularly. </p>
        <p lang="en-CA">We&rsquo;ll  post notice of modifications to these terms on this page.  Changes  will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are  posted. However, changes addressing new functions or changes made for  legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to  the modified terms for the Service, you should discontinue your use  of the Service.</p>
        <p lang="en-CA">If  there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the  additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>
        <p lang="en-CA">If  you do not comply with these terms, and we don&rsquo;t take action right  away, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we are giving up any rights that we  may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>
        <p lang="en-CA">If  it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not  affect any other terms.</p>
        <p lang="en-CA">Unless  otherwise expressly stated in these terms and conditions, all notices  from <span lang="en-US">you</span> to <span lang="en-US">us</span> must be in writing and sent to <span lang="en-US">our</span> contact email address at [<span lang="en-US"><em>contact  email address</em></span>] and all notices from <span lang="en-US">us</span> to <span lang="en-US">you</span> will be displayed on <span lang="en-US">the  Service </span>from to time.</p>
        <p lang="en-CA">If  any part of these terms and conditions is unenforceable (including  any provision in which <span lang="en-US">we</span> exclude or limit <span lang="en-US">our</span> liability to <span lang="en-US">you</span>)  the enforceability of any other part of these terms and conditions  will not be affected. If <span lang="en-US">we</span> choose not to enforce any right that <span lang="en-US">we</span> have against <span lang="en-US">you</span> at any time, then this does not prevent <span lang="en-US">us</span> from later deciding to exercise or enforce that right.</p>
        <p lang="en-CA">The  laws of Saskatchewan, Canada, will apply to any disputes arising out  of or relating to these terms or the Service. All claims arising out  of or relating to these terms or the Service will be litigated  exclusively in the federal or provincial courts of Saskatchewan,  Canada, and you and SEZZWHO consent to personal jurisdiction in those  courts.</p>
