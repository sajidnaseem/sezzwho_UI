            <p lang="en-CA">Some  jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied  warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,  noninfringement, data accuracy and data securit . To the extent  permitted by law we exclude any and all warranties including any such  implied or statutory warranties to the greatest extent that they can  be disclaimed.</p>
            <h2 lang="en-CA"><strong>Liability  for our Service</strong></h2>
            <p lang="en-CA">When  permitted by law, we are not responsible for lost profits, revenues,  or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential,  exemplary or punitive damages. To the extent permitted by law, the  total liability of Sezzwho for any claims under these terms,  including for implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid  us to use the Service, or if we should choose to do so to supplying  you the Service again.</p>
            <p lang="en-CA">In  all cases, Sezzwho will not be liable for any loss or damage that is  not reasonably foreseeable- for example if <span lang="en-US">you</span> lose revenue, salary, profits or reputation as a result of <span lang="en-US">your</span> use of the Service, and/or for the acts or omissions of any third  party such as other users of the Service, or any other indirect or  consequential loss or damage <span lang="en-US">you</span> may incur in relation to the Service and its <span lang="en-US">Content</span>.</p>

            <p lang="en-CA">We  may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to the  Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our  Service. You should look at the terms regularly. </p>
            <p lang="en-CA">We&rsquo;ll  post notice of modifications to these terms on this page.  Changes  will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are  posted. However, changes addressing new functions or changes made for  legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to  the modified terms for the Service, you should discontinue your use  of the Service.</p>
            <p lang="en-CA">If  there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the  additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>
            <p lang="en-CA">If  you do not comply with these terms, and we don&rsquo;t take action right  away, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we are giving up any rights that we  may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>
            <p lang="en-CA">If  it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not  affect any other terms.</p>

            <p lang="en-CA">If  any part of these terms and conditions is unenforceable (including  any provision in which <span lang="en-US">we</span> exclude or limit <span lang="en-US">our</span> liability to <span lang="en-US">you</span>)  the enforceability of any other part of these terms and conditions  will not be affected. If <span lang="en-US">we</span> choose not to enforce any right that <span lang="en-US">we</span> have against <span lang="en-US">you</span> at any time, then this does not prevent <span lang="en-US">us</span> from later deciding to exercise or enforce that right.</p>
            <p lang="en-CA">The  laws of Saskatchewan, Canada, will apply to any disputes arising out  of or relating to these terms or the Service. All claims arising out  of or relating to these terms or the Service will be litigated  exclusively in the federal or provincial courts of Saskatchewan,  Canada, and you and SEZZWHO consent to personal jurisdiction in those  courts.</p>
